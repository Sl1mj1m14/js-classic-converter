# Minecraft Javascript to Classic World Converter
Have you ever wanted to take your minecraft world out of the browser and into the olden days? Well now you can!
Minecraft Classic was the original development cycle of Minecraft, being created back in 2009, and despite originally being playable in the browser, now can only be played as a seperate application and store files locally. Minecraft Classic Remake was made 10 years later, being recoded in javascript, and being playable and storing worlds exclusively within a browser. As such, both of these formats, despite playing nearly identically, have entirely incompatible file formats. This program functions as a converter to convert Minecraft Classic Javascript Remake files to Minecraft Classic files.
